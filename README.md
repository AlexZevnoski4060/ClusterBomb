# ClusterBomb
## Automated tool for scanning and brute forcing web directory using pre-installed tools such as nmap, ffuf, gobuster, etc.

You are able to run the codes if you have already installed the required tools.

**Note**: *The project is not entirely finished yet. All the coding has been doing on the ARM chip*
